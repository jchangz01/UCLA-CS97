Lab 1.5 Questions
1. Where are the mv and sh programs located in the file system?
   	 mv and sh commands are located at /bin in the file system. (Command: “which <command>”)
   
2. What executable programs in /usr/bin have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r, and what do they do?
   	The executable programs are pr and tr.
    	    - pr: Convert text files for printing
   	    - tr: translate or delete characters
	    
3. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed?
   	When we execute /usr/bin/emacs, we are actually executing /etc/alternatives/emacs.  (Command: “readlink emacs” or “ll /usr/bin |grep emacs”)

4. What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program? Why are they different programs?
   	“/usr/bin/gcc --version”, output: 4.8.5
   	“gcc --version”, output: 10.2.0
    	These programs are different because the plain gcc is found inside /usr/local/cs/bin/ while /usr/bin/gcc is found in /usr/bin. (Command: “which gcc”)

5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?
       “chmod u+sx” gives owner of the file permission to execute the file and sets user or group ID on execution
       	“chmod o-w” removes other users not in the file group’s permission to write on the file

6. Use the find command to find all directories modified in the last four weeks that are located under (or are the same as) the directory /usr/local/cs.
       Command: “find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28”

7. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links?
       2732 Symbolic Links (Command: “find /usr/local/cs -type l | wc -l”)

8. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. Specify the name of the file without the /usr/lib64/ prefix. Consider files whose names start with ".".
   	librom1394.so.0.3.0  last modified on Dec 28, 2013 (Command: “ls -lta”)

9. Where does the locale command get its data from?
   	/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive and /usr/share/i18n/locales (Command: “man locale” and look for “FILES”)

10. In Emacs, what commands have downcase in their name?
       - downcase-dwim → M-x ... RET
       - downcase-region → C-x C-l
       - downcase-word →  M-l
       (Command: “C-h a downcase”)

11. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-r through C-M-v do? Can you list their actions concisely?
       C-M-r: runs the command isearch-backward-regexp; rather than a forward regexp search (C-M-s) starting below the cursor; C-M-v starts searching above the cursor
       C-M-v: runs the command scroll-other-window; let’s say you have two buffers on two separate screens, C-M-v will scroll the buffer that you are currently not in

12. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?
       C-g: Quits any running or partially typed command
       ex. We can abort a search (C-s) by typing C-g

13. What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes?
       C-y (yank): Reinserts the last piece of deleted text; also works as the copy and paste tool along with M-w (copy)

14. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?
       Besides having different color themes, the directory listing of the Emacs dired command (“C-x d”) displays all files including entries that start with ‘.’ while “ls -l” does not.

Notes on myspell
      myspell takes a text file as stdin and displays all misspelled 'alphabetical' words in that file.

      Everytime myspell is called, a "sorted.words" file is generated in your current directory
      with the sorted contents of /usr/share/dict/linux.words from the UCLA SEASNET server.

      The myspell implementation performs multiple spelling checks by performing multiple translations
      of characters (inspect 'myspell' shell script to learn more).
      Spelling checks disregard capitalization; to specify, 

      	 A file containing the word "Assignment" (uppercase A) will not be evaluated as a spelling error despite only
	 "assignment" (lowercase a) being present in sorted.words.
	 
      Because my implementation disregards capilization, the final output of all mispelled words
      will be in lowercase letter. This means a mispelled word like "ASDFGH" will be outputed as "asdfgh"
