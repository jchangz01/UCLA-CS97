Side-note:
	Invesigation could have also been made by simply using the command
	git log -source -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information"
	This would check the entire repo for any changes specified by the text 
	following the -S option. However, doing this may result in noticebly slower
	processing time because your machine has to look for all files and 
	all commits rather than specifying a file
