Looking at the GUI window generated by Gitk, I can see a clean visual 
representation of commits, branches, and merge paths on the the top left 
subwindow with author and date of a commit on the top right
On the bottom left subwindow, it shows the differences and changes
introduced by a selected commmit. The bottom right subwindow seems to show
comments and files impacted by a commit. Along with several more options, 
these are the primary subwindows presented in the Gitk GUI. 

The differences I noticed between Savannah's Emacs repo versus Eggert's
Emacs repo are the branch count and commit comount. In the Savannah's
version, the repo seems to only contain the master branch unlike Eggert's 
version. In Eggert's version, there are many more branches alongside the 
master branch. Regarding commits, I used the 'git rev-list --all --count' 
command to reveal the number of total commits between all branches and found
that Eggert's Emacs repo has 149396, while the Savannah repo has 149444. 
The greater number of commits in Savannah's repo may lead us to believe that 
it is a later version than Eggert's repo.
